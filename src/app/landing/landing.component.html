        Glad to see you! 👋 I am currently a software engineer with a passion for optimizing time and processes, striving
        to deliver the best code I can and continuously gaining as much knowledge as possible.

        But let's rewind a bit...🔹🔹
      </h6>
        <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-surface-500 dark:text-white/64">
          ▶️ In high school, I wanted to earn money to cover my additional needs. I found an advertisement for gathering
          contact data of companies attending fairs. Initially, I manually copied the contact details, but I quickly
          realized I could automate the process. So, I did it, and ended up doing the work of several employees at once
          🚀. I realized the power of coding.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-surface-500 dark:text-white/64">
          ▶️ After gaining some knowledge, experience, and customers, I founded a startup where I developed digital
          platforms that optimized operations for service-based companies. As my skills advanced and my client base
          grew, I began creating "ERP" systems. I collaborated directly with companies in industries such as automotive
          and agriculture, implementing systems that streamlined their business processes.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-surface-500 dark:text-white/64">
          ▶️ During my studies, I worked in an international environment at DeLaval, where I deepened my knowledge of
          microservice architecture and enterprise-based software. I then moved to Infor, where I currently work as a
          software engineer, developing features for enterprise software while collaborating with amazing people from
          all over the world.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-surface-500 dark:text-white/64">
          📌 In addition, I also develop my own software solutions and projects for small and medium-sized companies
          looking to optimize their time and operations.
